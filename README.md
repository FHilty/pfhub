# CHiMaD -- Phase Field

The aims of this repository are to have a location to

 * create and collate data comparing code capabilities

 * finalize a set of canonical phase field examples

 * push scripts, recipes (IPython notebooks for example)
   for building and running phase field codes that solve the canonical
   examples (or any other phase field examples)

 * link to virtual machines for phase field codes

 * store phase field meta analysis on such things as
   efficiency (memory use), convergence, capabilities or ease of use

 * any phase field code that has no home elsewhere
   including studentâ€™s phase field codes or phase field analysis

 * eventually include meta analysis tools for automated testing of
   multiple phase field codes

 * eventually include a generic high level API to describe phase field
   problems with hooks into multiple codes
