There are lots of analytical solutions we can compare against.\r\n\r\n(3) Create a PoroMechanics Action.\r\n\r\n(4) Extend to multiphase situation.  This is fairly trivial, if a little ugly.

Essentially it allows using time step to mimic the iteration. This is ok most of times. But it requires the evaluation of aux kernels and UOs on timestep_end during power iteration. In complicated simulations, there could be aux kernels or UOs should be evaluated on timestep_end ONLY but not at each power iteration. So I plan:\r\n\r\n1) ask the eigenvalue and solution difference always to be evaluated on linear;\r\n2) get rid of all timestep calls;\r\n3) manually copy their values to their old values (actually only the eigenvalue needs to be copied) at the end of each power iteration;\r\n4) get rid of solution output during power iteration completely.\r\n\r\nThis will significantly simplify the implementation as well simplify the input syntax.\r\n\r\nSome minor improvements can be made on the current input syntax, like:\r\n\r\n1) change `output_on_final` to `output_before_normalization`;\r\n2) make `xdiff` postprocessor only for InversePowerMethod;\r\n3) add `output_after_power_iterations` in NonlinearEigen to enable outputs after initial free power iterations.\r\n\r\nThis will require regolding and patches in herd.

Because of this, these material properties can not be set currently in `Material::initStatefulProperties(unsigned int n_points)`. Normal material properties will simply not be evaluated in the method.\r\n\r\nFor stateful material properties, `computeProperties()` should not be called at initial or `computeProperties()` should not do the evaluation at initial. But currently there is no such a protection in place.\r\n\r\nSo I can and have to go back to the old fashion, implement the initialization in `computeProperties()`, where I check if the evaluation is at time zero. This used to work because `FEProblem::initialSetup()` will evaluate all UOs and in turn the `computeProperties()` will be called.\r\n\r\nBut now only the UOs on initial is evaluated. If there no UO on initial the `computeProperties()` will never be called and leave the stateful material property uninitialized. If there are AuxKernels on initial, `computeProperties()` can still be called, but there is no guarantee AuxKernels on initial exist.\r\n\r\nYou may wonder why I did not use AuxKernel and let the kernel run both on initial and residual. The reasons are: 1) we used to not have high-order aux variables; 2) we used to not have multiple execute_on. After those two were fixed, I really do not have strong arguments to keep using stateful material properties.

I.e. any element of a tensor T can still be accessed through T(i,j,k,l), where for high symmetry tensors the values are computed on the fly. When writing to elements using T(i,j,k,l) = value the symmetry of the tensor is automatically downgraded if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the long run I hope this can help convince people to use the

When caught in a thread (in `ThreadedElementLoopBase`) it should call something like `_fe_problem.setException()` or whatever to set a flag that there has been an exception.\r\n4.  Threaded element loop will check that flag and `break` if it's set.\r\n5.  Outside the `ThreadedElementLoop` we will do an MPI \"max\" or whatever to get the flag across processors (note: We do not care that other processes will have kept running _their_ threaded element loops while the one processor that had an exception is hanging around waiting on them).\r\n6.  If the MPI max comes back showing that a processor had an exception then the MOOSE code itself will throw a _new_ exception (to unwind out of some place a few levels down in `computeResidual()`).\r\n7.  `computeResidual()` will have a try/catch wrapped around it.\r\n8.

The transient of one physics is so fast comparing with they other physics, so that at any time it reaches steady state instantaneously, i.e. its time derivative is zero. In this case, if this fast physics is modeled with a MultiApp, it will use the Steady executioner. We then have no choice but the FullSolveMultiApp at least for now. The current implementation in FullSolveMultiApp is not ready for this kinds of simulations. For example, `ex->init()` is called inside `solveStep()`; `auto_advance` is not allowed, and so on. We should have an improved version of it so that it can be used for fast physics along a transient physics. I believe those improvements should be quite strait-forward.\r\n\r\nThis also creates a related question: if we had to create steps to do a steady solve for the quasi-steady physics, we would not want to use the steps to constrain the time step of the master physics.

However, the new capability only works with properties in type of Real, RealVectorValue and RealTensorValue. Another frequently used type std::vector is missing. The reason is that the wrapped vector is resized during the evaluation. The size is not required at the time of construction with declareMaterialProperty(). As the result, we donot know how many aux variables are needed to add them automatically. I propose to have a watch optional parameter in declareMaterialProperty() to specify up to what index we want to output a vector property. 0 means no watch; 10 means create 10 aux variables for watching this vector. If the size of vector is smaller we simply not evaluate. This watch makes sense to other types: Real - 1, RealVectorValue - 1,2,3 by dimension, etc. It can be used for more types.\r\n\r\nWe can maintain one watchsize for one property although possibly the size are set differently on blocks for the same property. Also care needs to be taken for surface properties, ie _bnd==true.

is the eigenvalue, x is the solution vector, matrix A and B correspond two sets of kernels.\r\n\r\nThere are essentially two eigenvalue executioners inside Yak right now: PowerMethodExeutioner and NonlinearEigenExecutioner. As the name suggested, PowerMethodExecutioner uses the inverse power method to find the minimum eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector, and NonlinearEigenExecutioner uses JFNK to solve the eigenvalue problem.\r\n\r\nWhile PowerMethodExeucitioner is simple, in which we just need to make the set of kernels corresponding to B operates on the old solution vector, NonlinearEigenExecutioner is not that simple. NonlinearEigenExecutioner requires a good initial guess on k and x, so that the converged solution is the minimum eigenvalue and its eigenvector. This initial guess is typically obtained by doing few power iterations at the beginning. This poses a difficulty on the implementation with MOOSE, because now the set of kernels for B will operate on old solution vector at the beginning during the free power iterations and operate on the current solution during the nonlinear solve later. We need this NonlinearEigenExecutioner to get the solution faster than PowerMethodExecutioner most of times.\r\n\r\nAnother option on eigenvalue executioner is using arpack or Slepsc. But power method and nonlinear executioners still have their merit because they runs faster by considering only the fundamental mode (the minimum eigenvalue).\r\n\r\nThese executioners are frequently affected by MOOSE updates and are hard to maintain by developers other than MOOSE developers. Also having these executioners inside MOOSE will benefit lots of users who may be also interested in solving eigenvalue problems.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "labels": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/labels/C:%20MOOSE", "color": "0052cc", "name": "C: MOOSE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/labels/P:%20normal", "color": "ededed", "name": "P: normal"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/labels/T:%20task", "color": "cccccc", "name": "T: task"}], "locked": false, "title": "Move eigenvalue executioners from Yak to MOOSE", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/2350", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/2350/labels{/name}", "created_at": "2014-02-14T23:06:12Z", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/2350/events", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/2350/comments", "html_url": "https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/2350", "comments": 3, "number": 2350, "updated_at": "2014-04-13T21:18:14Z", "assignee": null, "state": "open", "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/YaqiWang", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6607496?v=3", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/received_events", "gravatar_id": "", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "site_admin": false, "login": "YaqiWang", "type": "User", "id": 6607496, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/followers"}, "milestone": null, "closed_at": null, "id": 27634673}, {"body": "second_phi_zero is currently broken - needs to be resized", "labels": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/labels/C:%20MOOSE", "color": "0052cc", "name": "C: MOOSE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/labels/P:%20critical", "color": "ffffb8", "name": "P: critical"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/labels/T:%20defect", "color": "e11d21", "name": "T: defect"}], "locked": false, "title": "_second_phi_zero is never resized!", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/2345", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/2345/labels{/name}", "created_at": "2014-02-14T23:06:09Z", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/2345/events", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/2345/comments", "html_url": "https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/2345", "comments": 0, "number": 2345, "updated_at": "2014-04-14T16:02:47Z", "assignee": null, "state": "open", "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/permcody/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/permcody/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/permcody/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/permcody", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/permcody/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/permcody", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/permcody/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3036960?v=3", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/permcody/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/permcody/received_events", "gravatar_id": "", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/permcody/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "site_admin": false, "login": "permcody", "type": "User", "id": 3036960, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/permcody/followers"}, "milestone": null, "closed_at": null, "id": 27634666}, {"body": "EPRI consultant Gregg was testing Peacock with RAVEN and decided to put some field-specific comments on the 'Name' line for several components.

Then another or master FEProblem will obtain these drift vectors as material properties on the fly during the residual evaluation. Right now I am wrapping the FEProblem holding the user objects with a general user object in the master FEProblem. Inside the general user object, I can obtain the user object on the wrapped FEProblem for retrieving the drift vectors defined on quadrature points. \r\n\r\nI would like to replace this wrapping general user object with MultiApp/Transfer so that things can be easier maintained and more intuitive.

The one for u will be \"Block 1\" and the one for v will be \"Block 2\".\r\n\r\nThen in the input file we do this:\r\n```\r\n[ [./u](Variables]\r\n)\r\n    ...\r\n    solve_on = 1\r\n    transfer_to = '2'\r\n  [ [./v](../]\r\n\r\n)\r\n    ...\r\n    solve_on = 2\r\n    transfer_to = '1'\r\n  [../]\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis will cause the following:\r\n\r\n1.  \"u\" will be subdomain restricted to block 1, \"v\" to block 2\r\n\r\n2.  Two auxiliary variables will be created:\r\n  - On block 2 an aux variable named \"u_transfer\"\r\n  - On block 1 an aux variable named \"v_transfer\"\r\n\r\n3.  At the beginning of computeResidual() we will do all of the interpolations from the blocks the variables are solved on to the blocks that they need to be transferred to storing the values in those aux variables.  For now, we'll just use the libMesh MeshFunction stuff, but later we'll figure out better ways to do the interpolation.\r\n\r\n4.  Inside MooseVariable::computeElemValues() if the element is not on the subdomain this variable is being solved on, the coefficients for evaluating that variable will come from the auxiliary variable.  But the values will still be stored in the same place (so coupling will work correctly... you'll still just couple to \"u\")\r\n\r\nIn this way everything will be transparent to every other part of MOOSE.

For example, '_converged, _cutback_occurred, _time_old, _prev_dt, _reset_dt ...' in the Transient executioner. Also '_time, _t_step, _dt, _dt_old from the problem' in the Transient executioner do not have to be declared. They look like the 'global' variables shared by the methods of the executioner class. Because the executioner could be fairly complicated, these global variables make hard for developers to understand the implementation of the executioners, which in my opnion is very important for them to add any desired new features. I suggest that somebody takes the responsibility to restructure the executioners. Variables needs to be declared as local as possible.\r\n\r\nThis seems not very ugent. And it could be a headache. But it will benefit all of us and make possible more developers participate the development of executioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCody's reply:\r\n\r\nI like this message and fundamentally you are correct but this\r\nis actually somewhat difficult to do in practice. In some cases these\r\nvariables are almost like global variables in that they are shared to\r\nthe kernels and other systems in MOOSE and they really need to be this\r\nway. In other cases some of these variables could be made more local\r\nbut then that limits our user's ability to customize these\r\nexecutioners to fit their needs. If you have ideas on ways we can\r\nimprove we welcome your suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy reply back to Cody:\r\n\r\nI think events like setting '_time' is significant, they should not be buried into a subroutine. Maybe we can change the name to __time, so we know it is a variable shared by other systems. \r\n\r\nI suggest let just remove all of these variables defined in the class and declare them in the 'execute' method and put everything in 'execute'. Then we try to cut 'execute' and use subroutine arguments for passing info. We may not be able to cut it properly for future extendability at the beginning. But as time goes by, it will grow better. \r\n", "labels": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/labels/C:%20MOOSE", "color": "0052cc", "name": "C: MOOSE"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/labels/P:%20normal", "color": "ededed", "name": "P: normal"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/labels/T:%20task", "color": "cccccc", "name": "T: task"}], "locked": false, "title": "Improvement on executioners", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/806", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/806/labels{/name}", "created_at": "2014-02-14T22:41:45Z", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/806/events", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/idaholab/moose/issues/806/comments", "html_url": "https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/806", "comments": 0, "number": 806, "updated_at": "2014-04-05T15:48:49Z", "assignee": null, "state": "open", "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/YaqiWang", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6607496?v=3", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/received_events", "gravatar_id": "", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "site_admin": false, "login": "YaqiWang", "type": "User", "id": 6607496, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/YaqiWang/followers"}, "milestone": null, "closed_at": null, "id": 27631870}, {"body": "The problem time is changed by Steady executioner.
